## Project Description
This project aims to create a powerful e-commerce platform designed specifically for a retail business. The envisioned website will serve as a comprehensive solution focused on facilitating efficient item sales and empowering the store to leverage data for informed marketing and business decisions. The project will concentrate on implementing key features to optimize the retail e-commerce process with a primary focus on:

### Responsive Design (On-Going):

Ensure the website is responsive and accessible across different devices, providing a user-friendly experience for customers.

Current prototype supports resizing of the site. More changes will be implemented as new features are added from the ongoing backlog.

### Product Showcase and Sales Optimization (On-Going):

Develop an engaging product showcase to highlight items with detailed descriptions, high-quality images, and pricing information.
Implement features that encourage upselling, cross-selling, and promotional activities to maximize sales opportunities.

The Prototype currently displays a well designed home page with highlighted products from various categories that should allow for the promotion of items & maximizing sale opportunities. The idea is to catch the consumer eye to bring their attention to certain items that may have higher clickthrough or sales.

### Customer Engagement and Feedback (On-Going):

Implement features to encourage customer engagement, such as newsletters, loyalty programs, and feedback mechanisms to gather valuable insights for continuous improvement.

The current prototype has Database models setup for consumer reviews. Future issues will target the implementation of such features that will use these models to track reviews.

### User Authentication (Done):

Establish a secure login system for both customers & admin.

The current prototype allows for user authentication via a functioning Log-In implementation (both front-end & back-end).

### User Registration (Done):
Establish a user account creation system customers.

The current prototype allows for user account creation via a functioning registration module (both front-end & back-end).

### Seller Authentication (To-Do):
Establish a secure login system leveraging existing registration code to authenticate seller profiles.

### Seller Registration (To-Do):
Establish a seller account creation system for sellers (e-commerce retailers).

### Account Management (On-Going)
Implement account management features that allow users to track order history, save favorite items, and receive personalized recommendations based on their purchase history.

### Payment Gateway Integration (To-Do):

Integrate a secure payment gateway supporting various methods to ensure a smooth and secure checkout process for customers. Current option is planned to be Stripe. 
This is unimplemented as of now.

### Data-Driven Insights & Tracking (To-Do):

Develop an intuitive admin dashboard tailored for retail store owners, providing insights into sales performance, customer demographics, and marketing campaign effectiveness.

Utilize data analytics to forecast demand trends, helping retail businesses optimize their inventory and prevent stockouts or overstock situations.

Integrate robust analytics tools within the Admin panel to track and analyze customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and popular products.

Provide actionable insights derived from gathered data to aid retail store owners in making informed marketing and business decisions. This would be items such as tracking how many clickthroughs to certain products, how many and which items have been added to cart but not checked-out, etc.

## Tech Stack
### MERN - Mongo DB, Express(.js), React(.js), Node(.js)
MongoDB — document database  
Express(.js) — Node.js web framework  
React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework  
Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server  

---

## Hosting / Provider
#### Vercel: 
A cloud platform for developing, deploying, and scaling web apps. 
Vercel serverless has been used to deploy both the front and back end implementations of the prototype design.

---

## Back-End

#### MongoDB:
The database management system utilized is MongoDB, providing a scalable and flexible NoSQL database to store and manage data efficiently.

#### Express.js 
is employed as the web application framework, facilitating the development of robust and scalable back-end APIs.

#### Node.js
The server runtime environment is based on Node.js, allowing for the execution of server-side JavaScript code and ensuring high performance.

---
## Front-End

#### React.js
The user interface is built with React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

#### Bootstrap 5 & CSS
Bootstrap 5 is utilized for front-end styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design across various devices and screen sizes.

---

## Developing Tools
#### Visual Studio Code:
Visual Studio Code serves as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) with extensions to support JavaScript, React, and Node.js development.

#### Postman:
Postman is employed for testing HTTP requests, allowing for the seamless testing and validation of back-end APIs independently of the front-end development.

#### npm (Node Package Manager):
npm is utilized for package management and dependency tracking, streamlining the integration of third-party libraries and tools.

#### Jest testing Suite
Jest provides fast and parallel test execution, helping to speed up the testing process.  It is designed to work right out of the box with minimal configuration required. 

It has been used within the project at different stages to assist with testing (via simple automation) and ensure product behaviour.

#### Figma:
Figma is used to create prototypes of interface design and animations for the web store pages.
